Welcome! 
    The scene of the game is a plane marked into cells, which can be unlimited, limited or closed.
Each cell on this surface has eight neighbors surrounding it, and can be in two states: to be "alive" (filled) or "dead" (empty).
The distribution of living cells at the beginning of the game is called the first generation. Each next generation is calculated based on the previous one according to the following rules:
in an empty (dead) cell, which is adjacent to three living cells, life is born;
if a living cell has two or three living neighbors, then this cell continues to live; otherwise (if there are less than two or more than three living neighbors), the cell dies (“from loneliness” or “from overcrowding”).

   The game is over, if not a single “live” cell remains on the field;
   
   Good luck!
